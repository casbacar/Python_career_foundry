This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Instacart's customer behavior patterns to provide valuable insights for the marketing and sales teams. The analysis will explore multiple dimensions including customer loyalty patterns, geographical differences in ordering habits, and the relationship between demographic factors such as age, family status, and purchasing behaviors.

The study will delve into creating detailed customer profiles by examining various aspects like order values, purchase frequency, and product preferences across different customer segments. By understanding these patterns and relationships, the project will enable the teams to develop more targeted strategies, optimize customer service, and enhance the overall shopping experience on the Instacart platform.
